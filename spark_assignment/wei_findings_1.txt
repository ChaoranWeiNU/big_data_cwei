From the histogram, we can find that the months with most crime rate are July and August. Moreover, the number of crime seems to correlate strongly with temperature. That is, the hotter it gets, more crime it is, and during the winter there are less crime. In my opinion, the reason for this pattern is that when the temperature is higher, people like to go out more, (with sunshine and stuff). And this will in turn give criminals the opportunities to conduct crime.
